A paper on the work I did during the Google Summer of Code 2011 for The NetBSD
Foundation (http://NetBSD.org). I was mentored for this project by
Joerg Sonnenberger.

The paper discusses the shortcomings of the conventional version of apropos(1),
which is basically that it doesn't work well for the one task for which it was
designed and that is search. Apropos has been part of all the modern Unix
implementations since it was first introduced in an early version of BSD and it
has probably remained unchanged in terms of its functionality.

Then the paper talks a bit about how these problems were overcome during this
project by leveraging the advancements in computing technology (better search
algorithms, more powerful hardware, cheap disk storage, etc.) and availability
of modern tools (mandoc, Sqlite), to develop a better search tool for man pages.
In the end it compares and contrasts some of the other projects which have
tried to tackle this problem in a different manner.
