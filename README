A paper on the work I did during the Google Summer of Code 2011 for The NetBSD
Foundation (http://NetBSD.org). I was mentored for this project by
Joerg Sonnenberger.

The paper discusses the shortcomings of the conventional version of apropos(1)
which has been part of all the Unix implementations since it was first
introduced in an early version of BSD and it has remained unchanged since then.

It talks a bit about how modern tools and techniques can be used together to
build a more usable search tool for man pages. In the end it compares and
contrasts some of the other projects which have tried to tackle this problem
in a different manner.
